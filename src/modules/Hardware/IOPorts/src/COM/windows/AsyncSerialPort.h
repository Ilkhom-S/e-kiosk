/* @file DEPRECATED - Implementation moved to include/Hardware/IOPorts/AsyncSerialPort.h

This file is kept for backward compatibility only.
The AsyncSerialPort class implementation has been moved to the public header
in include/Hardware/IOPorts/AsyncSerialPort.h to follow the project's
header organization standards.

All new code should include <Hardware/IOPorts/AsyncSerialPort.h> directly.
This file will be removed in a future version.
